# Journeys

Cities:Skylines mod to show full journeys, from beginning to end across all modes of transport.

The mod will show these full journeys for individual citizens, or for all passengers on a public transport, 
or for all citizens who will traverse a selected road or rail segment using any form of transport, or for all the
passengers who will use a selected transport line.  You can also show the journeys for all 40,000 or so instantiated
citizens in a single view.

The Journeys mod is extremely useful for studying utilization of public transport.
